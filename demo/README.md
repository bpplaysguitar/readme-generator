  ## Description
  This assignment was to use Javascript to create a web application that will generate passwords using random methods, based on user input of character types to be used in the generation of the password. I was able to learn a lot of new ways to use Javascript, including building entire arrays based on front-end user interaction, more in depth "for" loop and "if" statement uses, and I became very familiar with ASCII character codes. I also learned in talking about this with some developer friends, what makes a truly secure password. We went over the math of the possible permutations. In short: the longer the better, more than anything else. It's a gratifying feeling to build a highly functional and truly useful application, test it over and over, and get it work the way you want.
      
  #### Technologies Used
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
      
      
  ## Installation
  Ensure you have a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, and you have a terminal installed for Windows or the built-in Mac Terminal, and you have installed Git and the GitHub Desktop application (see https://desktop.github.com) and have an account, clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/bpplaysguitar/random-password-generator.git), create your own repository on GitHub, edit in your code editor and use GitHub to work in your repository (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html).

  ## Tests
  Many scenarios were run where the user would not select any character types for the password, or not specify a password length. I made sure the user has to provide the required input in order to generate a password.
