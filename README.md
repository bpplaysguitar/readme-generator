## Description
This README Generator helps busy developers make sure they have high quality, professional-looking README.md files for their project repositories. The README Generator runs in the command line and is simple to use. It presents the user with some simple questionsÂ about their project, and displays their responses within a pre-fabricated layout. Developing this README Generator gave me exposure to some new types of programming, moving away from webpage-based applications and getting familiar with working with Node in the command line.
